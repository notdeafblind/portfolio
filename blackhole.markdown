Click to drag the two planets, one on orbit, and the other freely. 
<br>
The orbital planet starts as blue. As it gets closer to the black hole center, its color gets more red, reflecting the planet's temperature. 
<br>
The free planet starts in the center. As it gets closer to the black hole center, it will start emit particles, simulating it being torn apart by gravity.
